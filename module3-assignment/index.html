          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl,
          a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and
          widespread domestic animals, with a total population of more than 19
          billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of
          food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in
          Southeast Asia, East Asia, and South Asia, but with the clade found
          in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the
          Indian subcontinent. From India, the domesticated chicken was imported
          to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC.
          Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the
          "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land
          between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
          Thutmose III.

          In the UK and Ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are
          primarily known as cocks, whereas in America, Australia and Canada they
          are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are
          cockerels. Castrated roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical
          castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a
          year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets although
          in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to
          lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also
          sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook to describe all
          ages and both sexes. The young are called chicks and the meat is
          called chicken.

          "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl. The species as a
          whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken"
          survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British
          public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many
          small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken
          Islands). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean
          females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide
          circulation.
        </p>

          In the Deep South of the United States chickens are also referred to by
          the slang term yardbird.

          Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
          search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small
          snakes or young mice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chickens may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed. The
          world's oldest chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age
          of 16 according to Guinness World Records.

          Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking
          plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
          (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder
          colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some
          breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
          pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification
          can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development
          of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the
          male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens
          have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and
          hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.
          Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat
          are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and
          combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff or
          beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra
          feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.
          Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although
          lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such
          as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
          may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally
          do so only to flee perceived danger.
